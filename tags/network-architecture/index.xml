      <description>Polynomial approximation can inform network design The following is a breif discussion of work found in this preprint which has been submitted to NeurIPS 2019. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ve left out many details. If you are interested in these details please see the preprint. As described in my previous post Neural networks have emerged as a very powerful tool for constructing nonlinear functions in high-dimensions. They are known to be very expressive in the sense that the class of functions they can approximate is very wide.</description>
