      <description>Towards a mathematical understanding of using neural networks for function approximation.  An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational framework inspired by the interactions of neurons in the brain.
 Recently many difficult problems have been effectively solved using algorithms and mathematical models which iteratively improve their performance based on data rather than explicitly finding a solution. Such methods, which primarily rely on data rather than explicit solution techniques, can be grouped together under the umbrella of Machine Learning.</description>
