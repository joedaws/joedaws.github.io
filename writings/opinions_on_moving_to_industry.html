  <h1>
My (subjective and opinionated) answers to some common questions about moving from Academia to industry</h1>
<p>
As my graduation from my Ph.D. program was approaching, I struggled with what direction I wanted to go into next. 
After going back in forth between pursuing careers in Academia or in industry,
I ultimately decided to pursue a software engineer career path. I have since worked as a software engineer
and researcher in machine learning (see my <a href="https://joedaws.github.io/about/resume.html">Resume</a> for additional details). 
Below are some questions and thoughts I have about transitioning from a math Ph.D. student to a job in industry.</p>
<h2>
Questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
What do I wish I had known as a graduate student?    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
It’s important to fail early and fail often (in order to set up a feedback loop from which you can learn rapidly). 
If pursuing a job outside of academia is remotely interesting to you, consider taking statistics and programming
courses and see if these fields are interesting to you. There are of course jobs that don’t involve these but in
my opinion, many awesome jobs involve applying statistics and programming to solve difficult business problems. 
If these fields are interesting to you, I recommend (in consultation with your advisor and committee) 
trying to incorporate programming into your dissertation work.      </li>
      <li>
Networking is extremely important! If you struggle with making new professional connections (as I do) be sure to 
ask trusted mentors or friends for help.      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
How is math (or subject of expertise) used in jobs I have had?    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
Many interesting problems in the real-world end up being able to be stated as a 
linear programming problem or some other flavor of optimization. Deep learning for example.      </li>
      <li>
When doing math, one needs a careful understanding of the definitions of the constructs they
are dealing with. Honing this kind of communication is important. I highly value my colleagues who 
communicate precisely and hope that I do the same.      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
What’s the difference between a master’s level industry job and a Ph.D. level job?
Since my experience is primarily with software engineering, that is all I feel I can commment on.
I’m not sure if my impression is accurate, but as far as I can tell, it really depends on the particular 
job or position. For example, if it is more research and development job then a candidate with a Ph.D. and publications
may be more prepared to self direct their own work and communicate about a new discovery 
(of course there are many master’s students who are excellent researchers). On the other hand, for a software development 
only job, there is very little difference, except some organizations may start your salary slightly higher if you have
a Ph.D. Some companies also want to fund research and would like you to work for them while publishing papers. In this 
case having completed a dissertation would probably help most be better prepared.    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
More opinions make for more informed decisions</h2>
<p>
If <em>you</em> have transitioned from Academia to industry, what are you answers to these questions?
I encourage you to answer them and post them in a place that current graduate students can see them!
I also think students are interested in the opinions of people who have transitions from industry to Academia!</p>
