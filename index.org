[[./img/crow.svg]] Hello, my name is Joseph (or Joe if you prefer monosyllabic names).

*I build software to help humans thrive.* I believe that software
can be used to improve the state of the world despite it's challenges
and potential dangers. One lens through which I view my work is
as a string of problem definitions and solving those problems.
Iterating on my understanding of the problem domain and the world is key.

* About Me

I believe machine learning can be used to improve the state of the world. However,
deploying these technologies requires a nuanced understanding of the business and
problem spaces. My belief in the possibility of positive outcomes guides my approach
to building. *Good software goes a step beyond solving a problem*, it should enable
humans to live a better life.

I am currently a Senior Machine Learning Software Engineer at [[https://onemedical.com/][One Medical]] where I am
working on automating laborious and monotonous tasks to give time back to health
care providers so that they may better connect with their patients.

* Recent Work
** Document Summarization
*Technologies Used*
=Python=, =Anthropic Claude=, =AWS Lambda=, =AWS DynamoDB=, =AWS IAM=, =AWS SNS/SQS=, =Terraform=

*Problem Description*
To achieve the highest quality in patient care One Medical's providers need to be able to
spend more time connecting and understanding their patients.

*Solution*
One area they might save time is gleaning the most relevant and important information from the documents associated with their patients. I developed a system which generates summaries of all patient's documents
which is consumed by an EHR and displayed along side the rendered document in an EHR UI.

** Automated Fax Routing
*Technologies Used*
=Python=, =Tensorflow=, =FastAPI=, =AWS Lambda=, =AWS IAM=, =AWS SNS/SQS=, =Terraform=

*Problem Description*
A team of Fax routers receives more faxes than they are able to process given their
team's service level agreement.

*Solution*
To lessen the burned of the fax routing teams' workload, I extended a routing system to automatically
processing incoming faxes. The system predicted key identifiers for each document. These predictions
were forwarded to an EHR which took an action based on the predicted values.

* Tools I use to build

*For Machine Learning Microservices* I've used and enjoy working with =Python=, =AWS SageMaker=,
=Docker=, =AWS Lambda=, =FastAPI=, =AWS ECS= to build microservices that serve machine learning
model predictions. I think this stack offers a path to building maintainable and
efficient machine learning microservices in a variety (but not all) contexts.

*For Web Applications* Some technologies I am excited about are =Haskell=, =IHP Platform=, =NixOS=. I expect to be able to use these build a robust, easily maintainable, and easily modifiable web applications. I am working
on a personal blog/second brain using IHP now. Please check back for updates on this project.

*I like learning about new tools* New problem domains (well those are new to me) likely have
established or new tech stacks that are better candidates to solving the problem than what I
have used previously. It's a pleasure to have the time to find a good solution and balance the
trade-offs when approaching a new problem. I don't believe in the existence of a perfect
tech stack.
